Understanding the Efficiency of Ray Traversal on GPUs
=============
This is a mirror of https://code.google.com/archive/p/understanding-the-efficiency-of-ray-traversal-on-gpus/ with several fixes:

* Ported .sln and .vcxproj to VS2015 and CUDA SDK v8.0
* Fixed "No appropriate pixel format found!" error on start up on Windows 10
* Built a x64 version

Part of this code is used in GPULightmass.
